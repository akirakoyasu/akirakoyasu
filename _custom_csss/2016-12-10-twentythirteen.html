<p>/*<br />
Welcome to Custom CSS!</p>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how<br />
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with<br />
your customizations.</p>
<p>By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,<br />
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS<br />
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all<br />
your theme's stylesheet content.<br />

.entry-content > p:first-child:first-letter {<br />
	font-size: 500%;<br />
	font-weight: bold;<br />
	float: left;<br />
	line-height: 1;<br />
}</p>
