<p>What are little boys made of?<br />
What are little boys made of?<br />
Frogs and snails<br />
And puppy-dogs' tails,<br />
That's what little boys are made of.</p>
<p>What are little girls made of?<br />
What are little girls made of?<br />
Sugar and spice<br />
And everything nice,<br />
That's what little girls are made of.</p>
